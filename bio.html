    <p> My name is Jovawn Wheatley I am 22 years old, 5'11. There is not much about me to really talk about I hobbies would be working out , reading manga or comic books, watching stand comedians, reading on psychology and etc. for startes that type of work that I do is called Calaesthenics which means which are compund exercises that attack multiple excercises at one which that weight is your own body which is good for losing weight which increase muscle definition. When is comes to reading I don't really reading but I do at times to for my own entertanment from time to time. But I love stand up comedy because I am type of person that loves a good laugth as like my same reason for psychology on how the human mind works I find that interesting.I would say that I am a person that keeps to myself most time not really type to start problems or randomly mean to anyone nor do follow others in a way just to fit in.</p>
